**Objective:** Extract, load, and transform (ELT) the UDS dataset to prepare it for analysis.

## Summary
In this ELT project, I created a MySQL database for storing and querying community health center data. Once the data was loaded into the appropriate tables, I used SQL to clean and manipulate the data to prepare it for future analysis. After the data had been wrangled, I queried the database to perform some high level data anlaysis.
