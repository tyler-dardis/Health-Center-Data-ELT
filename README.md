# Health Center Data ELT

In this SQL project, I created a database to store community health center data. Following the ELT process, I extracted the data from data.hrsa.gov, loaded the data into my SQL database tables, and transformed the data in preparation for data analysis.

The focus of this project was to use SQL queries to load and process the data, as well as perform some high level data analysis.
